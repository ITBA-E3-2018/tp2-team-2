\subsubsection{\color{red}High-Level and Low-Level Input Voltages}
The high-level input voltage ($V_{IH}$) es the minimum input voltage that is considered as high, while the low-level input voltage ($V_{IL}$)  is the maximum input voltage that is considered as low.

\subsubsection{\color{red}High-Level and Low-Level Output Voltages}
The high-level output voltage ($V_{OH}$) is the minimum output voltage that the circuit provides as a high, while the low-level output voltage ($V_{OL}$) is the maximum output voltage that the circuit provides as a low.

\subsubsection{\color{red}Noise Margin}
The high noise margin ($NM_{H}$) is the gap between the high-level input voltage and the high-level output voltage, while the low noise margin ($NM_{L}$) is the gap between the low-level output voltage and the low-level input voltage.
$$NM_{H} = V_{OH} - V_{IH}$$
$$NM_{L} = V_{IL} - V_{OL}$$

\subsubsection{\color{red}Propagation Delays}
For this assignment's meassures, when the input changes from low to hight and the output from high to low, the high-to-low propagation delay is considered as the time between the moment in which the input voltage reaches the $90\% $ of its maximum high value, until the moment in which the output voltage reaches the $10\%$ of its maximum high value.
$$t_{pHL} = t_{10\%V_{maxO}} - t_{90\%V_{maxI}}$$
In the case in which the input goes from high to low and the output from low to high, the low-to-high propagation delay is considered as the time between the moment in which the input voltage reaches the $10\%$ of its maximum high value, until the moment in which the output voltage reaches the $90\%$ of its maximum high value.
$$t_{pLH} = t_{90\%V_{maxO}} - t_{10\%V_{maxI}}$$

\subsubsection{\color{red}Transition Times}
The high-to-low transition time or fall time ($t_{f}$) is the time that it takes the output voltage to go from its high maximum value to its low minimum value, while the low-to-high transition time or rise time ($t_{r}$) is the time that it takes for it to change from its low minimum value to tis high maximum value.
